1.
  (The traffic light system must always ensure that exactly one of the lights is on at any given time)
SPEC
  AG(GreenLightOn XOR YellowLightOn XOR RedLightOn)

2.
  (If a pedestrian button is pressed or an emergency vehicle is detected, it implies that the red light for vehicles and green light for pedestrians will be on)
SPEC
  (PedestrianButtonPressed | EmergencyVehicleDetected) -> AF(RedLightOn & GreenPedestrianLightOn)

3.
  (When a pedestrian button is pressed and no emergency vehicle is detected, the system will eventually respond by activating the red light for vehicles and green light for pedestrians)
SPEC
  (PedestrianButtonPressed & !EmergencyVehicleDetected) -> AF(RedLightOn & GreenPedestrianLightOn)

4.
  (If a pedestrian button is pressed and an emergency vehicle is detected, the system will prioritize the emergency vehicle by ensuring its direction has a green light)
SPEC
  (PedestrianButtonPressed & EmergencyVehicleDetected) -> AF(GreenLightOn FOR EmergencyVehicleDirection)

5.
  (When an emergency vehicle is detected and no pedestrian button is pressed, the system will immediately change the traffic light to green for the emergency vehicle's direction)
SPEC
  (EmergencyVehicleDetected & !PedestrianButtonPressed) -> AG(GreenLightOn FOR EmergencyVehicleDirection)

6.
  (If an emergency vehicle is detected and the pedestrian button is pressed, the system will prioritize the emergency vehicle by ensuring its direction has a green light)
SPEC
  (EmergencyVehicleDetected & PedestrianButtonPressed) -> AG(GreenLightOn FOR EmergencyVehicleDirection)
