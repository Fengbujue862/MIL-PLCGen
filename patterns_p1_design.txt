1. Use Case: Control Traffic Light
   - Basic Flow: The system cycles through the traffic lights in a predefined sequence.
     Pattern: Invariant
     `{1}`: "GreenLightOn XOR YellowLightOn XOR RedLightOn"
   - Alternative Flow: Sequence interrupted by pedestrian button press or emergency vehicle detection.
     Pattern: Implication
     `{1}`: "PedestrianButtonPressed OR EmergencyVehicleDetected"
     `{2}`: "RedLightOn AND GreenPedestrianLightOn"

2. Use Case: Respond to Pedestrian Request
   - Basic Flow: System changes traffic light to red for vehicles and green for pedestrians after the current light cycle.
     Pattern: State change during a cycle
     `{1}`: "PedestrianButtonPressed AND NOT EmergencyVehicleDetected"
     `{2}`: "RedLightOn AND GreenPedestrianLightOn"
   - Alternative Flow: Emergency vehicle request takes precedence over pedestrian request.
     Pattern: Implication
     `{1}`: "PedestrianButtonPressed AND EmergencyVehicleDetected"
     `{2}`: "GreenLightOn FOR EmergencyVehicleDirection"

3. Use Case: Respond to Emergency Vehicle
   - Basic Flow: System changes the traffic light to green for the emergency vehicle's direction immediately.
     Pattern: State change during a cycle
     `{1}`: "EmergencyVehicleDetected AND NOT PedestrianButtonPressed"
     `{2}`: "GreenLightOn FOR EmergencyVehicleDirection"
   - Alternative Flow: Emergency vehicle request overrides pedestrian request.
     Pattern: Implication
     `{1}`: "EmergencyVehicleDetected AND PedestrianButtonPressed"
     `{2}`: "GreenLightOn FOR EmergencyVehicleDirection"

Each use case scenario is translated into a pattern that captures the essential requirements and constraints of the traffic light control system. Variables are defined to represent the status of the system and its responses to different inputs, ensuring that all aspects of the event flow are covered by the corresponding patterns. The patterns are designed to be mutually exclusive where necessary to avoid conflicting states, such as a light being both on and off at the same time.
